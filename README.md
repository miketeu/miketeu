- 👋 Hi, I’m @miketeu
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and front end skills.
- 🌱 I have completed the  Trilogy Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development. 
- 💞️ I am now researching to develope a software that I think will be very useful.
- I am interested to hear from anyone who would like to get involved in developing a Python Flask App. The app will have an atractive front end and will be storing and accessing data from a Sql database.
